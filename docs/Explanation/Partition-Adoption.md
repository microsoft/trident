# Partition Adoption

When Trident installs or services an operating system, there are times when existing partitions need to be preserved in the new OS. To accomplish this, these partitions can be adopted. To adopt a partition, the Trident host configuration can be modified to include details that help Trident identify the desired partitions. Either (not both) a label or uuid can be specified.
