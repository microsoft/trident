Explain the reason for making this change. What problem does it solve and what
goals does it aim to achieve?

and expanded upon to ensure the problem is explained in detail and all
necessary background is provided.

When possible, include specific use cases or customer stories that illustrate the
need for this change.

# Scope

## Requirements

<!-- (DELETE ME)
The specific objectives that the proposal aims to achieve.
List goals, in and out of scope items, customer stories, and implementation
constraints.
-->


## Out of Scope

<!-- (DELETE ME)
What is out of scope for this proposal?
-->

## Exit Criteria

<!-- (DELETE ME)
Define success metrics and conditions for considering the RFC implemented and
the corresponding issue closed.
-->

# Dependencies

<!-- (DELETE ME)
Call out other incomplete features that this design will depend on.
-->

# Implementation

<!-- (DELETE ME)
Describe the technical design and implementation plan for the proposed change.
This should include architectural diagrams, API draft and examples, and
relevant code snippets to better explain your design.
-->

# Public API Design

<!-- (DELETE ME)
If your feature includes an external facing API, produce an API Design document
with details and sample usage. Include a summary of the feature, example usage
covering all optional features, and the API specification. Highlight any
differences if the API is meant to be compatible with existing APIs. For simple
APIs, include inline in this document. For complex APIs, link bidirectionally
between the two documents.
-->

# Testing and Metrics

<!-- (DELETE ME)
Document how the feature will be tested - list out each test we need to write,
capturing any relevant test environments and test infrastructure changes that
might be needed. Also capture how we will monitor the feature.
-->

# Servicing

<!-- (DELETE ME)
When applicable, discuss how the new feature will be introduced into the
customer environments.

Elaborate on any impacts to backwards and forwards compatibility, and any
mitigations.
-->

# Implementation Plan

<!-- (DELETE ME)
[OPTIONAL]
When needed or appropriate, outline a phased implementation plan for the proposal.
-->

# Counter-Arguments

## Drawbacks

<!-- (DELETE ME)

-->

## Alternatives

<!-- (DELETE ME)
Describe alternative designs or approaches considered. Explain why the proposed design was chosen
over these alternatives.
-->

# Open Questions

<!-- (DELETE ME)
[OPTIONAL]
List any open questions that need to be resolved before the proposal can be
implemented. Ideally these would be addressed and resolved during the RFC
review process.
-->

# Future Possibilities
