# Run Specific Operations

In addition to running `trident install` and `trident update` fully to completion, Trident allows
breaking these commands into separate stage and finalize operations. The intent is that staging can
happen without workload disruption and finalizing can be delayed until the user is ready to reboot.

Staging an update involves streaming partition images and applying the indicated OS and bootloader
configuration. It generally takes on the order of 1-5 minutes, but the workload can continue running
while staging is in progress:

```
trident update --allowed-operations stage /etc/trident/config.yaml
```

Finalizing an update just sets the new boot order and triggers a reboot:

```
trident update --allowed-operations finalize /etc/trident/config.yaml
```
