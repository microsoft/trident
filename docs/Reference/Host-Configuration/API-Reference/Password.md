# Password

Password configuration for a user.

**NOTICE:**

As a security measure, **Trident does NOT support passwords** for Trident-created users. The only allowed value for this field is a locked password, which is the default when this field is skipped. A locked password means that the user account does not allow logging in using password authentication. It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication instead.
