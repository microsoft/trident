### `updateCheck` (optional)

Scripts to be run before Trident commits an updated target OS as 'provisioned'.  If any of the scripts fail, commit will not be completed and rollback will be triggered.

These scripts are run in the target OS. The `$TARGET_ROOT` variable will be set to '/' for consistency with postProvision scripts.
