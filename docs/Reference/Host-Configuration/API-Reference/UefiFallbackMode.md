# UefiFallbackMode

UEFI fallback mode

UEFI provides a mechanism for booting from an EFI file without a corresponding boot variable existing in NVRAM. This is known as the UEFI fallback mode, and it uses a specific file path (/EFI/BOOT) to locate the fallback bootloader.

This configuration option allows specifying how Trident should populate the UEFI fallback boot files during OS installation or update.

| Characteristic | Value  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type           | `enum` |

## Variants

### Conservative

During clean install, the UEFI fallback will be updated during `finalize` to boot to the target OS. During an A/B update, the UEFI fallback will be updated to boot to the servicing OS (the existing OS) during `finalize` and then will be updated to boot to the target OS when `commit` validates the target OS as healthy. This aligns with how Trident handles the UEFI boot variables during an update.

| Characteristic | Value          |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Type           | `string`       |
| Value          | `conservative` |

### Optimistic

During clean install, the UEFI fallback will be updated during `finalize` to boot to the target OS. During an A/B update, the UEFI fallback will be updated to boot to the target OS (the newly installed OS) during the finalize stage.

| Characteristic | Value        |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Type           | `string`     |
| Value          | `optimistic` |

### Disabled

No UEFI fallback boot files are installed.

| Characteristic | Value      |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Type           | `string`   |
| Value          | `disabled` |
