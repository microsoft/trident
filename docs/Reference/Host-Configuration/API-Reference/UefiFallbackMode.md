# UefiFallbackMode

UEFIFallback mode

UEFI provides a mechanism for booting from an EFI file without a corresponding boot variable existing in NVRAM. This is known as the UEFI fallback mode, and it uses a specific file path (\EFI\BOOT) to locate the fallback bootloader.

This configuration option allows specifying how Trident should populate the UEFI fallback boot files during OS installation or update.

| Characteristic | Value  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type           | `enum` |

### Rollback

In 'rollback' mode, the servicing OS boot files will be used as the UEFI fallback boot files. This mode is not valid for clean installs.

| Value          | `rollback` |

### Rollforward

In 'rollforward' mode, the newly installed or updated OS (the target OS) boot files will be used as the UEFI fallback boot files.

| Characteristic | Value         |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Type           | `string`      |
| Value          | `rollforward` |

### None

This is the default mode, where no UEFI fallback boot files are installed.
