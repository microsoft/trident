# UefiFallbackMode

UEFIFallback mode

UEFI provides a mechanism for booting from an EFI file without a corresponding boot variable existing in NVRAM. This is known as the UEFI fallback mode, and it uses a specific file path (/EFI/BOOT) to locate the fallback bootloader.

This configuration option allows specifying how Trident should populate the UEFI fallback boot files during OS installation or update.

| Characteristic | Value  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type           | `enum` |

## Variants

### Rollback

In 'rollback' mode, during an OS update, the UEFI fallback will be updated to boot to the servicing OS (the existing OS) during `finalize` and then will be updated to boot to the target OS when `commit` validates the target OS as healthy. This aligns with how Trident handles the UEFI boot variables during an update.

| Characteristic | Value      |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Type           | `string`   |
| Value          | `rollback` |

### Rollforward

In 'rollforward' mode, during an OS update, the UEFI fallback will be updated to boot to the target OS (the newly installed OS) during the finalize stage.

| Characteristic | Value         |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Type           | `string`      |
| Value          | `rollforward` |

### None

No UEFI fallback boot files are installed.

| Characteristic | Value    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Type           | `string` |
| Value          | `none`   |
