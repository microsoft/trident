# SoftwareRaidArray

Software RAID configuration.

The RAID array will be created using the `mdadm` package. During a clean install, all the existing RAID arrays that are on disks defined in the Host Configuration will be unmounted, and then stopped.

The RAID arrays that are defined in the Host Configuration will be created, and mounted if requested in the `storage.filesystems` config.

To learn more about RAID, please refer to the [RAID wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RAID).

To learn more about `mdadm`, please refer to the [mdadm guide](https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/A_guide_to_mdadm).

   | Format         | `Block Device ID` |

### `id` **<span>(required)</span>**

A unique identifier for the RAID array.

This is a user-defined string that links the RAID array to the `filesystems` config in the Host Configuration. The identifier must be unique across devices of all types in the Host Configuration.

| Characteristic | Value             |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Type           | `string`          |
| Format         | `Block Device ID` |

### `level` **<span>(required)</span>**

RAID level.

`raid1` is supported and tested.

Other possible values yet to be tested are: `raid0`, `raid5`, `raid6`, `raid10`.

| Characteristic | Value                       |

### `name` **<span>(required)</span>**

Name of the RAID array.

This is used to reference the RAID array on the system. For example, `some-raid` will result in `/dev/md/some-raid` on the system.
