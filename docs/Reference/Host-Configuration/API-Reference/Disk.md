# Disk

Per disk configuration.

| Characteristic | Value    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Type           | `object` |

## Properties

### `device` **<span style="color:orange;">(required)</span>**

The device path of the disk. Points to the disk device in the host. It is recommended to use stable paths, such as the ones under `/dev/disk/by-path/` or [WWNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Name).

| Characteristic | Value    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Type           | `string` |

### `id` **<span style="color:orange;">(required)</span>**

A unique identifier for the disk. This is a user defined string that allows to link the disk to what is consuming it and also to results in the Host Status. The identifier needs to be unique across all types of devices, not just disks.

TBD: At the moment, the partition table is created from scratch. In the future, it will be possible to consume an existing partition table.

| Characteristic | Value             |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Type           | `string`          |
| Format         | `Block Device ID` |

### `partitionTableType` **<span style="color:orange;">(required)</span>**

The partition table type of the disk. Supported values are: `gpt`.

### `partitions` **<span style="color:orange;">(required)</span>**

A list of partitions that will be created on the disk.

| Characteristic | Value   |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type           | `array` |

### `adoptedPartitions` (optional)

A list of pre-existing partitions that will be adopted from the disk.

Several options are available to match a partition to adopt. If more than one option is specified, ALL the provided criteria will be used to match the partition.
