# Agent Configuration

The Trident Agent Configuration file contains configuration details for Trident. It is used for all Trident commands. The Agent Configuration file path must be `/etc/trident/trident.conf`.

> In most cases, the default values of Agent Configuration are sufficient and should not need to be changed.

## Setting Custom Datastore Path

By default, Trident will use `/var/lib/trident/datastore.sqlite` as the path for the datastore. To configure a non-default path, the Agent Configuration file must contain a line defining the path like this:

``` conf
DatastorePath=/special/path/to/my-datastore.sqlite
```

> The datastore path cannot be hosted on an [A/B volume pair](./Glossary#ab-volume-pair) and must be an absolute path.
