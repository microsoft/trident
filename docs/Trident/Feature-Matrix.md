_Notes:_

- [1] Trident exclusively supports UEFI booting. BIOS booting is not supported.
- [2] Root-verity is supported with grub, but support for this feature
  will be deprecated soon.
- [3] A system installed with these features can be updated, but the features
  themselves cannot be activated during an update.
- [4] Currently, different sets of PCRs are valid, depending on the type of the
  target OS image. Please reference the [PCRs API](../Reference/Host-Configuration/API-Reference/Encryption.md) for details.
- [5] This feature cannot be used in conjunction with root-verity.

## Out-of-Band Features

These are features that exist outside of the normal servicing flows in Trident.
