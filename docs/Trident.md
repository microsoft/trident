_Notes:_

- [1] Trident exclusively supports UEFI booting. BIOS booting is not supported.
- [2] Root verity is supported with grub, but support for this feature
  will be deprecated soon.
- [3] A system installed with these features can be updated, but the features
  themselves cannot be activated during an update.
- [4] Currently, only PCR 7 is supported. Sealing against other PCRs is
  planned for a future release.
- [5] These feature cannot be used in conjunction with root verity.

### Out-of-Band Features

These are features that exist outside of the normal servicing flows in Trident.
