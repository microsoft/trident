If not specified, only the TPM 2.0 device will be enrolled.\n\nThe URL must be non-empty if provided. Other URL schemes are not supported at this time.\n\n### Recommended Configuration\n\nIt is strongly advised to configure a recovery key file, as it plays a pivotal role in data recovery.\n\n### File Format Expectations\n\nThe recovery key file must be a binary file without any encoding. This direct format ensures compatibility with cryptsetup and systemd APIs. Be mindful that all file content, including any potential whitespace or newline characters, is considered part of the recovery key.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nEnsuring the recovery key's confidentiality and integrity is paramount. Employ secure storage and rigorous access control measures. Specifically:\n\n- The file containing the key should only be accessible by the root user and have `0400` permissions set.\n\n- The recovery key should be a minimum of 32 bytes long and should be generated with a high enough entropy to defend against brute force or cryptographic attacks targeting on-disk hash values.\n\n### Generating a Recovery Key\n\nOne way to create a recovery key file on Linux systems is using the `dd` utility:\n\n> Note: The following example is for illustration purposes only. Be sure to generate > recovery keys with diligence and attention to security principles. Please adjust the > following example according to your own security policies and operational environment to > fit your specific security requirements and constraints.\n\n```sh touch ./recovery.key chmod 0400 ./recovery.key dd if=/dev/random of=./recovery.key bs=1 count=256 ```\n\nThis command generates 256 bytes of random data for the recovery key, sourcing entropy from `/dev/random`. Be aware, in environments with limited entropy sources, such as certain embedded systems, `/dev/random` may not provide sufficient data promptly. Alternative entropy sources or methods may be required.",
