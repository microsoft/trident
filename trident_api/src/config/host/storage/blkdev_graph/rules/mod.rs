//! #Constraint Declarations
//!
//! This module contains all the per-kind validation rules for block devices.
//! Generic rules that apply to all are covered directly in the build() function
//! of BlockDeviceGraphBuilder. (e.g. uniqueness of IDs)
//!
//! The rules declared in this section are used by BlockDeviceGraphBuilder to
//! validate specific
//!
//! The rules are declared in the order they are evaluated:
//! 1. Basic checks: Checks that do not depend on the graph.
//! 2. Target Kind validity: Can device of kind A refer to device of kind B?
//! 3. Member Count validity: How many members can a device of kind A have?
//! 4. Sharing: What referrers can refer to the same target as a given referrer
//!    at the same time?
//! 5. Field uniqueness: What field values must be unique across all devices of
//!    type A?
//! 6. Node Target validity: Are the targets of a given node valid? Do they meet
//!    all the required criteria?
