# This file is autogenerated by invert.py from: tests/e2e_tests/target-configurations.yaml
# Do not edit this file directly.
#
# The file is structured as:
#
# ```yaml
# <config_name>:
#   <hardware_type>:
#     <runtime>: <lowest_pipeline_ring>
# ```
#
# Where:
# - <config_name> is the name of the test configuration.
# - <hardware_type> is either "bm" (bare metal) or "vm" (virtual machine).
# - <runtime> is either "host" or "container".
# - <lowest_pipeline_ring> is the first test ring where this scenario should be run.
#
# The pipeline rings are ordered as follows (from earliest to latest in the validation process):
# pr-e2e, ci, pre, full-validation
#
# A scenario marked to run in a given ring will also run in all later rings.
# For example, if a scenario is marked as "pre", it will run in the "pre" ring and all higher rings
# ("full-validation").
# Scenarios not listed in this file will not be run in any ring.
